### Respiratory System and Pressures

##### Key Components
1. **Visceral Pleura** - The inner layer surrounding the lungs.
2. **Pleural Cavity** - The space between the visceral and parietal pleura.
3. **Parietal Pleura** - The outer layer attached to the chest wall.

##### Pressure Labels
- **A**: Intrapulmonary (Intraalveolar) Pressure
- **B**: Intrapleural Pressure
- **C**: Barometric (Atmospheric) Pressure

##### Pressures Overview
- **Intrapulmonary Pressure ($P_{\text{Pul}}$)**: Approximately 760 mm Hg or 0 mm Hg.
- **Intrapleural Pressure ($P_{\text{ip}}$)**: Approximately 756 mm Hg or -4 mm Hg (always less than $P_{\text{Pul}}$ by 4 mm Hg).
- **Atmospheric Pressure ($P_{\text{atm}}$)**: Approximately 760 mm Hg.

> Note: Pressures are always compared to atmospheric pressure.

### Why is Intrapleural Pressure ($P_{\text{ip}}$) Negative?
1. **Natural Elasticity of Lungs**
2. **Surface Tension**
3. **Elasticity of Chest Wall**

- During breathing:
  - The **visceral pleura** is pulled inwards, increasing the pleural cavity volume.
  - The **parietal pleura** is pulled outwards, further increasing the pleural cavity volume.
  
  This mechanism works to increase the thoracic cavity volume.

- **Boyleâ€™s Law**: 
  ```math
  P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
  ```

### Transpulmonary and Thoracic Pressures

#### Key Equations
1. **Transpulmonary Pressure ($T_p$)**:
   ```math
   T_p = P_a - P_b
   ```

2. **Trans-thoracic Pressure ($T_{tp}$)**:
   ```math
   T_{tp} = P_{\text{Pul}} - P_{\text{ip}} = 0 - (-4) = 4 \, \text{mm Hg}
   ```

3. **Trans-respiratory Pressure (TRP)**:
   ```math
   TRP = P_{\text{Pul}} - P_{\text{atm}} = 0 - 0 = 0 \, \text{mm Hg}
   ```

### The Inspiration Process

1. **Muscle Contraction**:
   - Intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribs and sternum outward.
   - Diaphragm contracts, increasing thoracic cavity volume.

2. **Pressure Changes**:
   - As volume increases, **intrapleural pressure** decreases.
   - During rest, $P_{\text{ip}}$ is approximately -4 mm Hg. During inspiration, it can go to -6 mm Hg.

3. **Effect on Pleura**:
   - When the parietal pleura is pulled, the visceral pleura follows, increasing lung volume and reducing $P_{\text{Pul}}$.

### Detailed Pressure Analysis

1. **Pressure Points**:
   - $P_{\text{Pul}}$: Goes from 0 mm Hg to -1 mm Hg during inspiration.
   - $P_{\text{atm}}$: Remains constant at approximately 760 mm Hg.

2. **Pressure Calculations**:
   - Transpulmonary Pressure ($T_p$): 
     ```math
     T_p = P_a - P_b = -1 \, \text{mm Hg} - (-6 \, \text{mm Hg}) = 5 \, \text{mm Hg}
     ```
   - Trans-thoracic Pressure ($T_{tp}$): 
     ```math
     T_{tp} = P_{\text{Pul}} - P_{\text{ip}} = -1 \, \text{mm Hg} - (-6 \, \text{mm Hg}) = 5 \, \text{mm Hg}
     ```

3. **Diffusion Law Application**:
   - Air flows into the alveoli due to pressure differences until intrapulmonary pressure equals atmospheric pressure.

### Final Note
$P_{\text{pul}}$ has to reach 760 mm Hg to balance with atmospheric pressure.
